<h1 align="center">NewsKart</h1>


## About
-In the NewsKart app, I've utilized the News API and integrated it with a React application to deliver the latest news to users. The app is designed to display news articles based on user interests, providing a personalized news-viewing experience. I've used fetch API to retrieve news data and ensured successful retrieval by logging the data to the console.

-To organize the display of news content, I've created React components such as NewsList and NewsItem. These components help structure the news articles by displaying relevant information like headlines, descriptions, and publication details.

-Additionally, I've implemented a filter functionality that allows users to customize their news feed based on their interests. By querying the API with user preferences, the app fetches filtered news, ensuring users see only the content they care about.

-Lastly, I've enhanced the user experience with an infinite scroll feature. As users scroll down, the app loads additional news content seamlessly, providing a continuous browsing experience.
